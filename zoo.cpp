/**
 * Implements a Zoo namespace with methods for constructing Grid objects containing various creatures in the Game of Life.
 *      - Creatures like gliders, light weight spaceships, and r-pentominos can be spawned.
 *          - These creatures are drawn on a Grid the size of their bounding box.
 *
 *      - Grids can be loaded from and saved to an ascii file format.
 *          - Ascii files are composed of:
 *              - A header line containing an integer width and height separated by a space.
 *              - followed by (height) number of lines, each containing (width) number of characters,
 *                terminated by a newline character.
 *              - (space) ' ' is Cell::DEAD, (hash) '#' is Cell::ALIVE.
 *
 *      - Grids can be loaded from and saved to an binary file format.
 *          - Binary files are composed of:
 *              - a 4 byte int representing the grid width
 *              - a 4 byte int representing the grid height
 *              - followed by (width * height) number of individual bits in C-style row/column format,
 *                padded with zero or more 0 bits.
 *              - a 0 bit should be considered Cell::DEAD, a 1 bit should be considered Cell::ALIVE.
