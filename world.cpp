/**
 * Implements a class representing a 2d grid world for simulating a cellular automaton.
 *      - Worlds can be constructed empty, from a size, or from an existing Grid with an initial state for the world.
 *      - Worlds can be resized.
 *      - Worlds can return counts of the alive and dead cells in the current Grid state.
 *      - Worlds can return their current Grid state.
 *
 *      - A World holds two equally sized Grid objects for the current state and next state.
 *          - These buffers are swapped after each update step.
 *
 *      - Stepping a world forward in time applies the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
 *          - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
 *
 *      - Worlds have a private helper function used to count the number of alive cells in a 3x3 neighbours
 *        around a given cell.
 *
 *      - Updating the world state can conditionally be performed using a toroidal topology.
 *          - Moving off the left edge you appear on the right edge and vice versa.
 *          - Moving off the top edge you appear on the bottom edge and vice versa.

/**
 * World::count_neighbours(x, y, toroidal)
 *
 * Private helper function to count the number of alive neighbours of a cell.
 * The function should not be visible from outside the World class.
 *
 * Neighbours are considered within the 3x3 square centred around the cell at x,y in the current state grid.
 * Ignore the centre coordinate, a cell is not its own neighbour.
 * Attempt to keep the logic as simple, expressive, and readable as possible.
 *
 * If toroidal = false then skip any neighbours that would be outside of the grid,
 * this assumes the grid is Cell::DEAD outside its bounds.
 *
 * If toroidal = true then correctly wrap out of bounds coordinates to the opposite side of the grid.
 *
 * This function is in World and not Grid because the 3x3 sized neighbourhood is specific to Conway's Game of Life,
 * while Grid is more generic to any 2D grid based cellular automaton.
 *
 * @param x
 *      The x coordinate of the centre of the neighbourhood.
 *
 * @param y
 *      The y coordinate of the centre of the neighbourhood.
 *
 * @param toroidal
 *      If true then the step will consider the grid as a torus, where the left edge
 *      wraps to the right edge and the top to the bottom.
 *
 * @return
 *      Returns the number of alive neighbours.

/**
 * World::step(toroidal)
 *
 * Take one step in Conway's Game of Life.
 *
 * Reads from the current state grid and writes to the next state grid. Then swaps the grids.
 * Should be implemented by invoking World::count_neighbours(x, y, toroidal).
 * Swapping the grids should be done in O(1) constant time, and should not invoke a copy.
 * Try and boil the logic down to the fewest and most simple conditional statements.
 *
 * Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
 *      - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
 *      - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 *      - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
 *      - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 *
 * @param toroidal
 *      Optional parameter. If true then the step will consider the grid as a torus, where the left edge
 *      wraps to the right edge and the top to the bottom. Defaults to false.

/**
 * World::advance(steps, toroidal)
 *
 * Advance multiple steps in the Game of Life.
 * Should be implemented by invoking World::step(toroidal).
 *
 * @param steps
 *      The number of steps to advance the world forward.
 *
 * @param toroidal
 *      Optional parameter. If true then the step will consider the grid as a torus, where the left edge
 *      wraps to the right edge and the top to the bottom. Defaults to false.
